# karabiner-windows-mode
Karabiner-Elements complex ruleset to make using Mac OS more sane by enabling common keyboard functionality used in Linux and Windows.

## Installation
Copy and paste the following URL into your browser window and Karabiner-Elements *should* ask to install the file:

    karabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsissoko/karabiner-windows-mode/master/windows_shortcuts.json

## List of Shortcuts
First, a note about how these shortcuts are named in Karabiner-Elements. They follow the convention

    Key (Modifiers, if any) [Special notes, if any]

so they should be easy(ish) to understand. Contact me if you have improvement suggestions.

Due to Terminal and iTerm2 being terminal emulators, they should receive raw inputs and handle them themselves. To that end, almost all shortcuts no longer apply to these applications. As such, the notes will no longer specify that the specific shortcut does not apply to Terminal/iTerm2 as that is now the default state. Instead, they will note when a shortcut still applies even in the terminal emulator applications.
